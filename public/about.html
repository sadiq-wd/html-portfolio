<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am an aspiring web developer navigating my way around the web. I work as a full time content writer at SportsKeeda, 
  and have previously worked as a journalist at The Free Press Journal in Mumbai. 
</p>

<p>I like to hit the gym, play video games and cook. The latter, I am not really good at, something many attest to. 
  I will update this website over the course of my learning.</p>
