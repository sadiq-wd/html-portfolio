<h1>The Best Video Games I've Ever Played</h1>
<h2>My top 3 games of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Resident Evil 4</h3>
<p>Notice how I didn't specify whether the remake or the original? I can't decide. 
    Both games are beyond amazing, and are titles I have sunk hundreds of hours into.</p>
<h3>Rainbow Six Siege</h3>
<p>Legitimately, the worst and the best game of all time. That pretty much sums the game up really.</p>
<h3>Yakuza 0</h3>
<p>80s Japan, an engaging story and a kickass soundtrack. You really don't need much more</p>
